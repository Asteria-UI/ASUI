Welcome, Asterians!

My goal in creating ASUI was to offer Asterians a simple, easy to use interface that will provide at-a-glance information about your character and their surroundings. The base UI package is almost completely aesthetic, and will not directly impact your gameplay in any way.

The UI currently includes:

[Fill this in later.]

All of which is optional, and can be enabled / disabled at your preference. There are a myriad of customization options, which can be seen by using the ASUI SETTINGS alias.

If you have any questions, suggestions, concerns or just wish to talk about the UI, please don't hesitate to contact me on Discord - MentalThinking#9997
